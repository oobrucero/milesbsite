        I feel like putting an event or collection of some sort in a specific creative timeline and path is very special. This website in many ways is my dream and displays aspects of my personality that I don’t typically share with other people. It's weird to think about creating something of your own when you've never been truly encouraged to go out of your way to make new entirely of your own ability and person, it leaves me with so many questions! How does one create social backing without exposing themselves? Do I have enough material to make a statement or to display a concept/idea? Would people hurt me in their criticisms without even realizing it? What lies within creative works that communicates the solemnity of the project, in what way does such a catalyst reveal itself to the average viewer? The lackluster projects manufactured by corporate voices which are then regurgitated by social media stars - are they truly worthy of residing next to something of my own which has only been reviewed and given the green light by me? I’m going to try and answer all of these questions through this website while also giving whoever views it the chance to gain a better understanding of who I am as a person, and where my creative drive extends itself outside of my head. I appreciate you visiting.
