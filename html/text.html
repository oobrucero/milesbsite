    <p>don’t dismiss the darkness, invite it to inspire creativity and passion. the darkness is a gateway to a world of possibilities. nothing is good or bad, those are made up concepts sounds like star wars shit haha.. accept the dark side’ , but you really should, don’t dismiss the occasional ‘terrible’ thought, instead see it through. people think they’re better than who they are. in reality people are assholes who live on this planet with no existential purpose worth living for, so we substitute that need with morals, values, and relationships. Dismissing dark thoughts is like dismissing a part of yourself, you should see it through, you aren’t better than the person you see in your thoughts, you are the person in your thoughts. trying to avoid ‘bad’ thoughts is childish and stupid, and leaves you half blind to the truth of it all.

        i feel like putting an event or collection of some sort in a certain creative timeline and path is very special. this website in many ways is my hopes and dreams, the aspects of me that most don’t really have a chance to notice.
    how does one create social backing without exposing themselves? do i have enough material to bare? would people laugh at me, tear me apart, hurt me without even realizing it themselves? what lies within creative works that communicates the solemnity of the project, how does one average being notice it ? the lackluster projects manufactured by social media stars, are they truly worthy of residing next to my craft? 
    i look down on those revealing their ideas to the world through conventional medias of the modern internet; places that not only distort creativity, but mock it entirely, encasing the few jewels accessible within the ever increasing trash pile of social scrap.
